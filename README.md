# batchRAStoXY

This python script converts and normalizes Rigaku XRR instruments' files (.ras) to .xy files which are widely used in crystallography and reflectometry software such as [GenX](https://genx.sourceforge.io/).

# How to

- Put all your .ras files in one folder then run the script.
- Enter the directory of the folder containing your .ras files as input when prompted.
- The output files names contain will be written to the same directory but will have _normalized.xy suffix.
