# batchRAStoXY

- RAS files from Rigaku XRR are made ready for use with GenX as xy files for reflectometry data analysis.
- Put all your RAS files in one folder then run the script.
- The script only requires the directory of the folder containing your RAS files as input.
- The output files names contain _normalized.xy.

Happy interface analysis :)
